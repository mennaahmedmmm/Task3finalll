Opened VScode by:
code. 
/////////////
Table of contents : index.html / project.html/ task.html/ test2.html/ test.html 
In index.html:
1-moved from the working directory to staging area to start commiting by : git add
2-Moved to the localrepo to write commit by : git commit -m ""
3- Pushed the data to the remote repo by: git push 
/////////////
In project.html:
1-  Unstage files that have been previously added to the staging area in Git:  git restore --staged project.html 
2-Moving to the staging area : git add
